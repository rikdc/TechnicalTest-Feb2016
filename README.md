## Technical Test

This is my formal submission for your technical test.

### Brief.

Easting  and  Northing  fields  represent  the  position  of  the  associated  address  on  the  UK  National Grid, measured in metres from an optional origin at position (0, 0).
Using any of the provided files, implement a small web application to search for all addresses that  lie  within  a  square  region, centred  around a  user  provided address.

The  width  of  the square should be  customizable by the  user. For the  purposes  of this exercise,  an address is considered to be a combination of Thoroughfare, Posttown and Postcode values
